-wasted memory, each pokemon will have space for two types
-one type pokemon will have two types, as type 2 will default to NORMAL

- I'm accepting the wasted memory, instead changed the enum type to have a NONE value, which
defaults to 1 for both attack and defence.
-abolished the overloaded constructor; now we have to put NONE for one types' second value

-move default moves from pokemon and make it its own map; battle pokemon will house the
moves and have the default moves loaded in.
-same with all moves, needs to be moved to another map (giving us 3 maps to make a whole)
